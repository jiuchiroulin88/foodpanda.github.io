        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today's shift: 11:45-14:45</p>
<p>The second order was by a male mainland student and he lives in a ÂîêÊ®ì. Somehow, we two chinese mainlander are speaking English to each other....and I was focusing on his cat, wondering at the door when he was trying to pull out his money....after he shut the door I realized there is 0.5 dollar less! However, I felt embarassed to go back and asked for the money... I tried to reach CS but CS said either I paid or I went back and asked for the money.. I was like speachless. Gel told me that's the case.</p>
<p>Third order, I spent almost 10 mins looking for the customer's building. End up that is a fancy resident place in No. 1, Sai Yuen Ln........</p>
<p>The customer is nice in the phone but when I went up, he opens the door while hiding behind the door and only reached out his hand to me.... I pondered a little bit and he murmured a littble bit as well, indicating me to pass on the bag.</p>
<p>Gel told me about his past experience as a walker working around Central, Western Island area and how he suffered from the height in this area. He also told me the disavantages being a fake contract employer as the system would send him the orders with longest distances which passed on by other riders...</p>
